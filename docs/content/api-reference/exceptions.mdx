# `jaxis.exceptions`

Jaxis raises domain-specific exceptions to make failures actionable (bad specs, missing
args, invalid shapes, etc.).

## Construction / Spec Errors

These usually indicate that the `DeferredCall` or an archetype was configured incorrectly.

- `MissingArgumentsError`: required keyword args for your function were not provided.
- `InvalidArgumentsError`: you provided a kwarg that your function does not accept.
- `InputAlreadyProvidedError`: you provided a value for an argument that Jaxis is supposed
  to generate (via `input_spec`).
- `InputSpecMissingError`: archetype missing `with_input_spec(...)`.
- `OutputSpecMissingError`: archetype missing `with_output_spec(...)`.
- `PositionalArgumentsProvidedError`: positional arguments are not supported.

## Shape / Axis Errors

These usually indicate that your declared axis does not match runtime shapes.

- `OutputAxisMissingError`: the output is missing the axis you declared.
- `MaskShapeMismatchError`: mask axis shape does not match the input axis shape.
- `InputShapeTooSmallError`: the input axis is too small to perturb meaningfully.

## Debugging Checklist

1. Re-check your `input_spec` argument names and shapes.
2. Confirm the axis you passed is actually present at runtime.
3. For tuple outputs, confirm you used `(axis, tuple_index)` in `output_spec`.
