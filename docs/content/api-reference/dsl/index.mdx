# `jaxis.dsl.Metric`

Jaxis includes a small DSL for declaring pass/fail gates based on computed metrics.

You can:

- Compare metrics to thresholds (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`)
- Combine comparisons with `&` (AND) and `|` (OR)
- Pass the resulting expression as `test_spec=...` to semantic checks

## Import

```py copy
from jaxis.dsl import Metric
```

## Example

```py copy
from jaxis.dsl import Metric
from jaxis.semantics import is_permutation_equivariant

spec = (Metric.P99 < 1.0) & (Metric.MAX < 3.0)
ok = is_permutation_equivariant(fn, test_spec=spec)
```

<Callout type="warning">
Keep the parentheses. Python's operator precedence does not always do what you want when
mixing comparisons and `&` / `|`.
</Callout>

## Where To Learn The Metrics

The meaning of each metric is explained on the dedicated docs pages:

- [Metrics & Bespoke Test Specs](/metrics)
- [Composing Metrics](/composing-metrics)

<Callout type="info">
Implementation details like `jaxis.dsl.ast.*` are intentionally omitted from the public
reference.
