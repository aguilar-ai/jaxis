description: Wrap functions with axis specs for semantic testing.

# `jaxis.fn`

Semantic property checks need two things:

1. A function to call.
2. A declaration of which argument(s) and axis are being tested.

`DeferredCall` is the wrapper used to provide that declaration.

## Import

```py copy
from jaxis.fn import DeferredCall
```

## Next

See [DeferredCall](/api-reference/fn/caller) for the full reference and examples.
