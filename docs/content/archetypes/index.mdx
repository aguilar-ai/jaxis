# Archetypes

An archetype is a *bundle of semantic properties* that usually travel together. It is
the fast path: you say what kind of axis you have (batch, time, mask), and Jaxis runs the
appropriate semantic checks with sensible defaults.

Why archetypes exist:
- They encode common expectations (e.g. batch axes should be elementwise independent and
  permutation equivariant).
- They reduce decision fatigue: no need to hand‑craft a spec for each property unless you
  want to.
- They surface meaningful failures with a single call to `verify`.

Archetypes do **not** replace semantic properties. They are the “preset.” When you need
precision, you should compose property checks directly or override the spec used by the
archetype.

## Available Archetypes

- **Batch** — for sample axes that should be independent and order‑agnostic.
- **Time** — for causal / prefix‑safe axes (optionally also permutation equivariant).
- **Mask** — for masked/padded axes where masked values must not leak into unmasked
  outputs.

## Where to go next

- [Batch Archetype](/archetypes/batch) for the most common preset.
- [Interpreting Results](/archetypes/interpreting-results) to understand outputs.
- [Advanced Usage](/archetypes/advanced-usage) to override the default specs.
