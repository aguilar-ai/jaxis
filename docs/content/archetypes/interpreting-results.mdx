# Interpreting Results

Archetype checks return an `ArchetypeResult` with one or more `CheckResult` entries.
This page explains what each field means and how to reproduce failures.

## Result Types

`verify()` always returns an `ArchetypeResult`:

- `passed`: overall pass/fail (all checks must pass).
- `checks`: per‑property results (e.g. permutation equivariance, elementwise independence).
- `input_specs` / `output_specs`: the inferred specs used for the run.
- `args`, `trials`, `atol`, `rtol`, `dtype`, `rng`: the parameters that defined the run.

Each `CheckResult` includes:
- `name`
- `passed`
- `trial_index` (first failing trial)
- `rng` (the failing RNG key)
- `artifact_path` (if failure artifacts are enabled)

## Re-running a Failure

Every semantic check is reproducible by reusing the failing `rng`:

```py copy
result = Batch(loss).verify(...)
failed = [c for c in result.checks if not c.passed]
if failed and failed[0].rng is not None:
  # re-run the exact failing trial inside the semantic helper
  from jaxis.semantics import is_permutation_equivariant
  is_permutation_equivariant(fn, rng=failed[0].rng)
```

## Failure Artifacts

If you enable artifacts (`.with_failure_artifacts(enabled=True)`), failures serialize a
payload to disk. The payload includes:

- archetype name, check name, function name
- `rng` and `trial_index`
- input/output specs and user args
- tolerances and dtype
- **test spec used for that check** (stringified)

This is the quickest way to hand a reproducible failure to someone else.

## Exceptions vs. Failures

- Exceptions (`MaskShapeMismatchError`, `OutputAxisMissingError`, etc.) indicate a bad
  spec or incompatible axis shapes.
- Failures mean the spec was valid and the function violated the property at runtime.

## What to do after a failure

1. Confirm the axis spec (input/output) is what you *meant*.
2. Re-run the exact trial with the stored RNG.
3. Inspect upstream transforms along the axis (normalization, masking, pooling, etc.).
4. Tighten/loosen the test spec only after you understand the failure.
