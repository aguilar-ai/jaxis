# Composing Metrics

When you test for a semantic property using one of the predefined functions, you are
reusing a preconfigured test specification that is written using the `jaxis.dsl.Metric`
enum. The enum can be compared and composed using the `&` (AND) and `|` (OR) operators to
create more complex test specifications.

```python
from jaxis.dsl import Metric

spec = (Metric.P99 < 1.0) & (Metric.MAX < 3.0) # The parentheses are not optional.
```

These metrics can then be passed to any function from `jaxis.semantics` that accepts a 
`test_spec` argument.

```python
from jaxis.semantics import is_elementwise_independent

is_elementwise_independent(fn, test_spec=spec)
```
