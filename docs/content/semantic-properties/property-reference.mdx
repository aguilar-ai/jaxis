# Property Reference

This page details all the semantic properties available in Jaxis as of the latest release.
For help reading pass/fail outputs, see
[Interpreting Results](/semantic-properties/interpreting-results).

## Elementwise Independent

_Also known as Diagonal Dependent._

Each output depends only on its corresponding input, and changing one input affects only 
its own output and nothing else.

See the [Elementwise Independent](/semantic-properties/elementwise-independent) page to
learn more.

### Applications

- Losses, metrics, per-example heads
- Token axis in per-token prediction
- Channel axis in convolutional layers
- Spatial axis in image processing

#### Verify with Jaxis

Use `jaxis.semantics.is_elementwise_independent` for a single randomized trial or
`jaxis.semantics.is_elementwise_independent_trials` for repeated testing across different
random seeds.

## Permutation Equivariant

Permuting the inputs and then applying the function gives the same result as applying the 
function first and then permuting the outputs in the same way.

For a permutation $\pi$, we have:

$$
f(\pi(x)) = \pi(f(x))
$$

See the [Permutation Equivariant](/semantic-properties/permutation-equivariant) page to
learn more.

### Applications

- Training loops, losses, metrics
- Token axis in attention _before positional encoding_
- Entity axis in multi-entity models
- Node axis in graph neural networks
- Point axis in physics models

#### Verify with Jaxis

Call `jaxis.semantics.is_permutation_equivariant` to run one trial or
`jaxis.semantics.is_permutation_equivariant_trials` to repeat the verification until it
either fails or reaches the configured maximum number of trials.

## Permutation Invariant

Permuting the inputs does not change the output at all.

For a permutation $\pi$, we have:

$$
f(\pi(x)) = f(x)
$$

See the [Permutation Invariant](/semantic-properties/permutation-invariant) page to
learn more.

### Applications

- Sums, means, maxes, mins over a set axis; bag-of-feature type processing
- Computing dataset level metrics
- Graph classification
- Self attention followed by pooling

#### Verify with Jaxis

Run `jaxis.semantics.is_permutation_invariant` for an individual trial or
`jaxis.semantics.is_permutation_invariant_trials` when you want deterministic pass/fail
signals over multiple random permutations.

## Mask Invariant

For any mask $m$, changing inputs at masked positions does not change the outputs at
unmasked positions.

More verbosely, mask invariance means that if you mark certain outputs as "don't care" or 
"not present," changing the values of those masked inputs won't affect the outputs for the 
unmasked positions. You can put any garbage in the padded slots — zero, random noise, 
whatever — and the real outputs stay the same. The function genuinely ignores what it's 
told to ignore.

See the [Mask Invariant](/semantic-properties/mask-invariant) page to learn more.

### Applications

- Almost all NLP, audio, time-series
- Batches with partial validity
- Causal attention

#### Verify with Jaxis

Use `jaxis.semantics.is_mask_invariant` to perturb masked positions once or
`jaxis.semantics.is_mask_invariant_trials` when you want to sweep multiple RNG seeds to
guard against stochastic failures.

## Triangular Dependent

_Also known as Causal, Temporal Dependence_

Triangular dependence means that each output in a sequence can only "see" inputs that came
before it or at the same position — never inputs that come later. If you're computing the
fifth output, it can depend on inputs one through five, but not on inputs six, seven, and
so on. Information flows forward through the sequence, never backward.

See the [Triangular Dependent](/semantic-properties/triangular-dependent) page to learn 
more.

### Applications

- The venerable causal attention mechanism
- Time series forecasting, demand forecasting, anomaly detection
- Real-time recommendations
- RNNs, SSMs, RWKV-style models
- Causal ML

#### Verify with Jaxis

Run `jaxis.semantics.is_triangular_dependent` for a quick check or
`jaxis.semantics.is_triangular_dependent_trials` if you need a recorded `TestState` across
several random perturbations.
