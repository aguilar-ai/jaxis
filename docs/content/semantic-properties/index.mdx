# Defining Semantic Properties

A **Semantic Property** is a testable claim about what a function means, not just what it 
computes. When you say an axis is a "batch axis," you're asserting something about 
intent — that examples are independent, interchangeable, and processed in parallel. The 
function's code doesn't declare this; you do. 

## How They Work

A semantic property is a predicate $P : (\mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}) \to {\text{true}, 
\text{false}}$ that constrains the functional relationship between inputs and outputs 
along specified axes. These predicates are defined extensionally — by the input-output 
behavior they require — rather than intensionally by inspecting implementation.

We test this empirically: generate random inputs, compute outputs, and verify the 
constraint or constraints hold.

## What "Semantic" Means here

We should concede the sleight of hand — "semantic" here is a borrowed term. We are not 
capturing meaning in any deep sense; we are capturing *structural regularities* that we 
have decided correspond to meaning. The gap between "this function is elementwise 
independent" and "this axis is a batch axis" is bridged by convention. The tests verify 
the mathematics; responsibility for the semantics remains with you, the programmer.

## Semantic Properties Are Composable

Individual properties can be combined to test complex patterns. An archetype, which you 
have encountered or will later encounter, is a composite property that bundles multiple 
semantic properties together.

## Practical Tradeoffs

Some properties are easier to test empirically than to define formally. We prioritize 
tests that catch real bugs over mathematical purity — if a test reliably finds problems in 
practice, we include it.
