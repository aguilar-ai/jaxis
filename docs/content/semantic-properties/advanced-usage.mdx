# Advanced Usage

Jaxis uses a collection of defaults in order to determine whether a function fulfils a 
semantic property. These defaults are fully configurable through what can be generously
referred to as a DSL. 

The [Metrics](/metrics) page details all available metrics and their purpose.

## Additional Resources

- [Composing Metrics](/composing-metrics) for practical spec patterns.
- [Designing a Testing Strategy](/designing-testing-strategy) for choosing metric tradeoffs.
- [Property Reference](/semantic-properties/property-reference) to see where custom specs
  apply.
- [Interpreting Results](/semantic-properties/interpreting-results) to analyze outcomes.
