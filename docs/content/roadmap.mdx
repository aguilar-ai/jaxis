# Planned Improvements

Jaxis is early-stage software. The core abstractions — axes, archetypes, and semantic 
properties — are stable, but the library of specific archetypes and properties is still 
growing. 

The checklist below reflects our current roadmap. If you need something that's not here 
yet, or if you've discovered a semantic property that's particularly useful in your 
domain, we'd love to hear about it. Open an issue or submit a PR — expanding Jaxis' 
vocabulary is a community effort.
